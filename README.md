# restreamer-helper-bot

A discord bot that integrates with Twitch, Nightbot and SpeedGaming to provide automated stream command updates to authorized crew.

Also provides basic moderator-friendly features such as schedule information to simplify the workload of the organizers, 
and a few QoL commands for easier maintenance.

To make this work on your system, you'll need a config.js file full with the client tokens for all relevant services and you'll likely need
to change the code so it accepts your channels.
